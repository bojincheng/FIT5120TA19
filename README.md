# 🏖️ Beach Safety Simulation Platform

This project is part of the FIT5120 Applied Project for Monash University. It provides an interactive, educational web platform that helps users learn about beach safety, rip currents, drowning risks, and beach rescue procedures through engaging simulations and animations.

## 📽️ Live Animations & Educational Simulations

The platform includes a series of HTML-based animations and visual simulations that represent real-world beach dangers and safe practices:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HomePage.html` | 🌐 Main landing page linking to all animations |
| `Final_rip_current_sim.html` | 🌊 Demonstrates how rip currents form and pull swimmers away |
| `Final_escaping_rip.html` | 🏃‍♂️ Shows the safest way to escape a rip current |
| `drowning_danger.html` | ⚠️ Visualizes how drowning can occur near shore |
| `beach_comparison.html` | 📊 Allows users to compare safety conditions across different beaches |
| `Life_rescue.html` | 🆘 Highlights beach rescue techniques |
| `rip_currents.html` / `rip_currents_tab.html` | 📚 Informational pages on identifying and avoiding rip currents |
| `beach_rescue.html` | 🎥 Simulates a complete beach rescue sequence |

🎓 Educational Purpose
This project is designed to raise awareness among beachgoers—especially perants:

How to recognize dangerous beach conditions

What to do if caught in a rip current

How drowning often goes unnoticed

The role of beach patrol and rescue procedures
